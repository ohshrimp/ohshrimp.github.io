Hey! I'm Shrimp, and after a really productive year of online content creation, I went offline for almost two years. 

## What happened?
I was streaming as a job as a break from my coporate career, which, all things considered, is a stupid way to make a living. Starting out with no audience, no prospects, and honestly? Not really being into the streamer culture? I'm not sure how I convinced myself to get started when everything is stacked against success.

Even so, the community was kind, sending donations and cheers which kept things going for a while. I paid a few bills, but despite the warm reception and overwhelming support, I had to return to the office to maintain the cash flow.

It's for the better.

### Why??
Living on the generosity of others is not how I want to see myself. I don't like asking for help, and I can't imagine essentially begging for it without giving back in some meaningful way. So I'm spinning up this blog like it's 2002 to share my experiences, short text-based tutorials, and anything that might be helpful to you in your streaming endeavors as a way to give back to a community that did so much for me. 

And! I have the opportunity to return to doing something I love so much without the pressure of using it to stay alive. What a gift.

## What's next? 
A few streams here, a few posts there, and a healthy smattering of extra content that you can use for your own streams, all under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) license. You're free to share and adapt the content here, even for commercial use, as long as you don't claim it as your own or prevent someone else from using it. Freebies galore.
